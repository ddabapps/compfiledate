CompFileDate Build Instructions
===============================

These instructions assume you are building the program using Delphi 12. Later
versions of Delphi may be suitable.


Step 1: Download the Source
----------------------------

The program's source code is maintained in the delphidabbler/compfiledate
repository on GitHub. See https://github.com/delphidabbler/compfiledate

Either clone or download the repo into a directory on your computer. The
following directory structure will be created within your nominated directory:

    .
    |
    +-- Docs
    |
    +-- Src
        |
        +-- Assets


Step 2: Configure the Build Environment
---------------------------------------

The following tools must be installed to build CompFileDate:

+ Delphi 12.1 or later

+ `VIEd.exe` (Version Information Editor by DelphiDabbler). See
  https://delphidabbler.com/software/vied.

The program will not compile without setting the VIEDROOT environment variable
to the path where the VIEd binary is installed. By default this is in
%ProgramFiles(x86)%\DelphiDabbler\VIEd on 64 bit Windows and 
%ProgramFiles%\DelphiDabbler\VIEd on 32 bit Windows.

VIEDROOT can be set within the Delphi IDE. To do this choose the Tools | Options
menu option to display the Options dialogue box. Then select the IDE |
Environment Variables page and create the environment variable in the System
Overides section of the page. Alternatively set the environment variable
globally in Windows before starting Delphi.


Step 3: Modify the Source

If you intend modifying and redistributing CompFileDate you must comply with
CompFileDate's open source licence. See 
https://github.com/ddabapps/compfiledate/blob/master/LICENSE.md for details.


Step 4: Compile

From the IDE you have the choice of building 32 or 64 bit versions of the
program. Debug and release targets are both supported.

Everything is compiled into a _build sub-directory of the directory where you
copied the source. This directory is hidden from Git. 


Step 5: Release (optional)

Releases are created by running Deploy.bat from the command line, NOT from
within the Delphi IDE. Deploy.bat has its own dependencies and requirements
which are explained in the comments at the top of the script file.

The script compiles release versions of both 32 and 64 bit versions of the
program and parcels them up in zip files, along with the appropriate
documentation.


Step 6: Clean Up

If you cloned the CompFileDate repo using Git you can clean up easily by opening
a Git command line on directory where the clone was made. Then run:

    git clean -fxd

Make sure you have committed any new files that you need first!
