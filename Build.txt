CompFileDate Build Instructions
===============================

These instructions assume you are building the program using Delphi XE. Later
versions of Delphi may be suitable with some minor changes to the make file.


Dependencies
------------

The program has no dependencies other than the Delphi VCL.


Build Tools
-----------

The following tools are required to build the program:

+ A Delphi XE or later installation. The following tools are required:
  - `DCC32.exe` command line compiler.
  - `BRCC32.exe` resource compiler.
  - `MAKE.exe` the Borland / Embarcaero make utility (other make tools will not
     suffice). The following instructions assume that `MAKE` is on the system
     path. If not you must specify the correct path when running `MAKE`
+ `VIEd.exe` (Version Information Editor by DelphiDabbler). See
  https://delphidabbler.com/software/vied.
+ `Zip.exe` This program is used to create CompFileDates's release file. You can
  get a Windows command line version at
  http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip.


Environment Variables
---------------------

The make file uses the following environment variables, which should be set
before calling Make, or defined on the Make command line:

+ `DELPHIROOT` - should be set to the install directory of the version of Delphi
  being used. If not set it is assumed that Delphi is installed in the same
  directory as `MAKE.exe`.
+ `VIEDROOT` - set to the install directory of `VIEd.exe`. If not set then
  `VIEd.exe` is assumed to be on the path.
+ `ZIPROOT` - set to the install directory of `Zip.exe`. If not set then
  `Zip.exe` is assumed to be on the path.


Download the Source
-------------------

The program's source code is maintained in the delphidabbler/compfiledate Git
repository on GitHub. See https://github.com/delphidabbler/compfiledate

Either clone or fork the repo into a directory on your computer. The following
directory structure will be created within your nominated directory:

Build the Program
-----------------

### Command Line

The program is built using the `Makefile` located in the `Src` directory.

Open a command line console and navigate to the `Src` directory.

First configure the source tree by running `Make config`. This creates a `Build`
directory in the root that in turn contains `Bin`, `Exe` and `Release`
sub-directories.

The program can now be created simply by running `Make` with no parameters.
Intermediate binary files will be placed in `Build\Bin` and the program
executable will be written to `Build\Exe`.

To create a release run `Make release` after running `Make`. This creates two
zip files, one containing the executable code and the other the source code. The
zip files are placed in the `Build\Release` directory.

### Using the Delphi IDE

The program can be built using the Delphi IDE. Before this can be done you
should run `Make config` followed by `Make resources` to configure the source
tree and create the binary resource files required to build the source.

### Other Build Options

There are other build options available. See the comments in `Makefile` for
details.
